    <h1>Final Project Proposal: Steward Plant Care app // proof of concept</h1>
    <p>My intent for this project is to create a working mock-up of a plant care application that will empower users to manage their garden needs with a digital logbook of their plant care.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Background: Contextual Goals for the Steward app</h2>
    <p> The ultimate application for this resource would be to combine horticultural data on landscape and indoor plant varieties and the weather tracking features of a farmer's almanac, along with the tracking history for individual plants (or plant communities) that the user (the "Steward") is caring for.</p> 
    <p>Pulling the care instructions, weather predictions, and plant care history together would create a garden tasks list for the Steward. This will allow them to complete care tasks in an efficient and timely manner, logging their gardening activities in real time with minimal distraction from the technological interruption of creating each logbook entry.</p>
    <p>Ideally, this will eventually utilize the 'tap' capabilities of NFC tags to grab plant identifier from garden tags as an input mechanism, allowing Stewards to log a set action (watering, fertilizing, pruning, harvesting) for each plant whose NFC tag was tapped. As this action occurs, the Steward would be able to visualize task progress on a map as a means of tracking progress of their garden tasks--perhaps even in real-time.</p>
    <p>For example, the app might suggest <strong>fertilizing all apple trees</strong> in three seprate orchard plots, but not the intermixed peach trees. The app would suggest the task "[ FERTILIZE ] [ APPLE TREES ]", and users would click on the task action when ready to start mixing the fertilizer. This would pull up instructions on which fertilizers from the Steward's inventory to use, the correct ratios to dilute it with water, and then show the Steward a map of colored pins showing each apple tree was due for this fertilizer application. After fertilizing each tree, the Steward would tap their phone against the plant's garden tag, and the fertilizer application would be logged to the plant's history and its pin removed from the task map.</p>

    <h2>Current Goals for this Project</h2>
    <p>For the CT120 Final Project iteration, my goal is to create a working model for this ultimate application in order to demonstrate its capabilities and generate collective interest in working towards the app's development. </p>
    <p>Outlining the dataset for linking will require me to create a starter set of plants to work from, and arrange the data-modeling, initially within a set of relational databases in spreadsheet form, and eventually transferred into JSON as a CSV files. The concern here is that the resulting data might be "flat," and could be limited to functioning as keywords without the ability to stack multiple conditions. (Per @Aphid) As a result, I anticipate it may not narrow the suggestions for the Steward concisely enough to make use of without feeling clunky. Being able to compile and track multi-select categorical data (plants that like full and partial sun, but will not tolerate full shade, for example) will be an interesting data tracking connundrum to investigate.</p>
    <p>To create the proof of concept model for the CT120 final project's scope, I'm planning to utilize relational data sets to link the garden Steward's plant care logbooks with a second data set that has plant care information for landscape plant types. The goal will be to create a new record as an entry in the Steward's plant inventory, and link it to information about that plant species care information from the guidebook dataset.</p>
    <p>I will compile this information from guidebooks and websites such as CalFlora. I'm hoping to utilize the guideposts from <a href="https://www.knack.com/blog/how-to-design-an-effective-relational-database/">Knack's "How to Build a Relational Database: A Complete Guide,"</a> as well as considerations learned by Low Tech Magazine when building the <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about/the-solar-website/">Solar Powered Website</a> to keep the resulting interface as nimble as possible, making it more reliable for the Steward to self-host or even maintain locally on a mobile device.</p>

    <h3>Research Tributary: Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) Software Options</h3>
    <p>Firebird seems like the open-source RDBMS that I trust to use for this project. I want something that is open-source so that it can be locally hosted by Steward communities whenever possible, and I want a nimble framework that reduces the energy demand to run the program. It seems to have a reputation for its efficiency without sacrificing capabilities, and can be used in embedded applications, and bonus points--it's free to use! I think that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrhEbZ1g7qo">"2023 - Firebird Open Source Database Quick Start"</a> posted to YouTube by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FrOSConorg">Free and Open Source Software Conference (FrOSCon) e.V</a> will be a useful guidebook for setting up my initial dataset for testing, and potentially for the project as a whole.</p>
    <br>
    <strong>Other RDBMS Options I Considered</strong>
    <p>I am dissuaded from using Oracle products in general, due to their org's problematic nature with regard to tech governance, so <strong>MySQL</strong> is less appealing to me in spite of its ubiquity. <strong>CouchDB</strong> seems like a good option for its familiar JSON data storage and HTTP API, but from a cursory internet search (Google, "Apache software problematic," 2025-05-24), I find the company, Apache Software Foundation (ASF) to be potentially problematic, continuing to use an Indiginous company name and only <a href="https://fossforce.com/2024/07/apache-foundation-says-goodbye-to-iconic-feather-logo/">updating its feather-based logo</a> long after being <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/11/native_american_apache_software_foundation/">informed it was cultural appropriation</a>. In addition to this, there seem to be <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/apache-warns-of-critical-flaws-in-mina-hugegraph-traffic-control/">recent security concerns</a> regarding their products as of December 2024. Though not specifically related to CouchDB, as a novice one-person dev team focused on providing low-oversight tools for gardening enthusiasts, I wouldn't be able to trust ASF with (1) my IP and (2) other sensitive information (Steward garden locations and activity, for example) in good faith.</p>

    <h3>Ultralight Websiting: Design Principles</h3>
    <p><a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about/the-solar-website/#how">How is the website designed?</a></p>
    <li>Static websites generate a single time and don't rely on connections to servers for web traffic to trigger a server request in real time. This requires file storage and require less energy (in processing power) than the recurrent computation that "dynamic websites" use. <strong>Self-hosted relational databases will require the ability for users to both selectively import entries the databases (species information initially, but there is a use case for importing individual plant histories between applications, for use by a nursery business or even when one Steward takes over land previously cared for by another Steward). Additionally, it will be necessary for Stewards to be able to create their own records in not only their own garden inventories, but for new varietals or entire species of plants, even when offline. I'd like to have a way for users to upload the new (non-inventory) records to be reviewed and offered to other Steward users in the spirit of open-source collaboration.</strong></li>
