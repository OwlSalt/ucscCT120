    <h1>Final Project Proposal: Steward Plant Care app // proof of concept</h1>
    <p>My intent for this project is to create a working mock-up of a plant care application that will empower users to manage their garden needs with a digital logbook of their plant care. The ultimate application for this resource would be to combine horticultural data on landscape and indoor plant varieties and the weather tracking features of a farmer's almanac, along with the tracking history for individual plants (or plant communities) that the user is caring for. Pulling the care instructions, weather predictions, and plant care history together would create a garden tasks list for the Steward (user), and allow them to complete care tasks in an efficient and timely manner, logging the activities in real time with minimal distraction or technological interruption of these tasks. Ideally, this would utilize NFC tags to 'grab' plant identification data from garden tags and visualize task progress on a map.</p>
    <p>For example, the app might suggest fertilizing all apple trees in three seprate orchard plots, but not the intermixed peach trees. The app would suggest the task, and users would select the parent task. This would pull up instructions on which fertilizers from the Steward's inventory to use, the correct ratios to dilute it with water, and then show the Steward a map of colored pins showing each apple tree was due for this fertilizer application. After fertilizing each tree, the Steward would tap their phone against the plant's garden tag, and the fertilizer application would be logged to the plant's history and its pin removed from the task map.</p>
    <p>For this Final ProMject , my goal is to create a working model for this ultimate application in order to demonstrate its capabilities and generate collective interest in working towards the app's development. </p>
    <p>Outlining the dataset for linking will require me to create a starter set of plants to work from, and arrange the data-modeling, initially within a spreadsheet and eventually transferred into JSON as a CSV file. The concern here is that the resulting data might be "flat," and potentilally could be limited to functioning as keywords without the ability to stack multiple conditions and narrow the suggestions for the Steward concisely enough to make use of. Being able to compile and track multi-select categorical data (plants that like full and partial sun, but will not tolerate full shade, for example) will be an interesting data tracking connundrum to investigate.</p>
