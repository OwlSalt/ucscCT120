<title>Rachel Carson supercut</title>
<h1>Rachel Carson: An Environmental AMERICAN EXPERIENCE</h1>

<h2>Documentation of the process using a code-oriented tool, library, framework I hadn't used before</h2>
<p>I have admired Rachel Carson's work to outline the relationship between chemical pesticide use and environmental and human health damages for years now, and was excited for the opportunity to utilize two tools new to me, yt-dlp and Videogrep, to create a supercut of a PBS AMERICAN EXPERIENCE special on her life. </p>
<p>I started the process by following the Videogrep tutorial <a href="https://lav.io/notes/videogrep-tutorial/"</a href>here</a>, and got stuck in with Terminal testing my recall of command line prompts to download and utilize yt-dlp, which I used to extract the video and caption files for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFDh9c34XX4"</a href><a>the documentary on Rachel Carson</a> off of the PBS YouTube page.</p>
