<h1>Rachel Carson: An Environmental AMERICAN EXPERIENCE</h1>

<h2>Documentation of the process learning to use a code-oriented tool, library, framework I hadn't used before</h2>
<p>I have admired Rachel Carson's work to outline the relationship between chemical pesticide use and environmental and human health damages for years now, and was excited for the opportunity to utilize two tools new to me--yt-dlp and Videogrep--to create a supercut of a PBS AMERICAN EXPERIENCE special on her life. </p>
<p>I started the process by following the Videogrep tutorial <a href="https://lav.io/notes/videogrep-tutorial/">here</a>, and got stuck in with Terminal testing my recall of command line prompts to download and utilize yt-dlp, which I used to extract the video and caption files for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFDh9c34XX4">the documentary on Rachel Carson</a> off of the PBS YouTube page.</p>
<p>I had to search the web and take breaks regularly to get through the initial steps of simply accessing the tools I wanted to try using for this project. After a few tries, it became clear that I needed to create a virtual environment within Terminal that would allow me to install and run Videogrep, since it was not available within the Homebrew library that I had previously been accustomed to using. (I did later learn how to run Command line prompts from within VS Codium, but moved forward with the project in Terminal just for the sake of making progress and not wanting to continue 'running into brick walls.')</p>
<p>After I was able to create a sort of sandbox environment to experiment with Videogrep based on <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/">this tutorial</a>, I started experimenting with the program's functionality, exporting short video clips based on one-keyword searches in the video file I had downloaded. I reviewed several based on keywords that I had picked up on while watching the video and from my own personal experience of Carson's work area. Once I had found several supercut videos with several pertinent clips each, I played with combining the search queries together along with padding times (settling on 1.3 seconds before and after the designated clips) to find a combination that felt like it fit the storyline of the PBS documentary and of Carson's life's work. </p>
