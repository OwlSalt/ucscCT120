    <h1>EASzzZ WUI Disaster Communications Map</h1>
    <p>This mapping project sought to further my research goals from a research seminar I took this quarter, Eco-Metropolis, where I completed interviews to understand the polycrises that Santa Cruz and the Monterey Bay region are experiencing: housing insecurity, climate change, and social-political inequities combine to make Santa Cruz County one of the top 10 least affordable places to live in the United States. This forces people to move further from their workplaces and live in conditions that would otherwise be deemed uninhabitable, and means these residents are in areas much more prone to natural disaster risks.</p>
    <p>This mapping component of my research served to help me understand several questions related to the Eco-Metropolis research project, but was completed for Digital Platforms course under the prompt, "Is There Any World To Come?"</p>
    <p>These research questions included: What are the risks as a resident of the Santa Cruz Mountains Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI)? How are residents and responders communicating about that risk? What might these mapped components tell us about what it would take for neighbors and communities to do resiliency improvements, such as defensible space mitigations and home hardening improvements?</p>
    <p>Skills acquired include: </p>
    <li>conversion of GIS mapping files into open formats suitable for OpenStreetMap import</li>
    <li>data visualization styling to make complex information more accessible and easier to interpret</li>
